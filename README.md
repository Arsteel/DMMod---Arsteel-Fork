# Manual Installation and Launch
Drop the top-level DMMod folder into your D2R `mods` folder (the file path will look like `Diablo II Resurrected > mods > DMMod > DMMod.mpq` if you did it correctly), if you don't have a `mods` folder then create it in your D2R folder.

# What is DMMod?
DMMoD is a mostly vanilla (like ~95% vanilla I'd say) mod that aims to address some of the balance gaps in vanilla D2R with a combination of nerfs, buffs, and other changes while maintaining the "feel" of the game.
